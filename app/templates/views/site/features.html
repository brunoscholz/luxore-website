						The Looks, your photos, will live in your Vitrine - a fancy french name for the "feed". 
						Your followers will see everything you post there, following a style, a trend, or your creativity... 
						You can explore your looks, your body type, events, make-up, hair-style, shoes, underwear, socks, 
						bracelets, necklaces... Anything you want. The idea is to be found and be on command of your own style!

						To describe your looks you can tag it, like "party formal dinner long-dress", plus situations such as wedding, new years eve, or walking the dog on the beach, and body types like pear, plus-size, skinny, etc. When you apply tags to your looks, people can find you and cheer your work. Tags make it easy to find everything about fashion by filtering the search results and showing only what matters to you!

					<h1 class="title">Coin</h1>
					<p>
						Yeah, we have a coin! LUX is a token, a crytocurrency, built with the same premises of Bitcoin using Lisk: a platform for building blockchains and decentralized apps!<br>
						The idea is to cut off the bureaucracy and, like other cryptocurrencies, be safe. All the financial transactions inside Luxore network will be made with LUX. That guarantees the valuation of the whole system. There will be created 1 billion LUX Coins in two years, and it will not be possible to create more or less than this! Every user will have an address that works like your bank account number and you can send and receive money with it, protected by a passphrase that only you know.

					<h1 class="title">Gamification</h1>
					<p>
						A feature borrowed from games are achievements systems. They stimulate and engage people. Thophies and badges are virtual rewards that are given to users by their performance and they will be tied to professional paths: if you like make-up, you can post about it and become a reference by going deeper into the subject, gaining visibility, having others loving your work, and for each accomplishment you will have a badge, a title, or a trophy to show as proof of your dedication! They can be used as a guide showing the way and the possibilities inside the network, leading to more earnings. In games, characters with a higher level are more likely to beat the challenges of the stages, users with higher achievements beat easily the barriers of visualization... But all in a funny way!

					<h1 class="title">Social</h1>
					<p>
						Being social is the whole point so don't be mean - read about our <a ui-sref="app.ethics" class="linx">ethical guidelines</a>. When you like a look, you should show your apreciation as well as when you dislike it. To any look, you have 2 buttons: cheer and boo! This is the more common way you can interact with others and participate in the network... You can also share the look with your followers or put it inside a list... Of course, you can leave a comment too. The comments can be deleted by the Look owner or they can be flaged as inappropriated: a snake (or something) will be placed in it so other people know that it is a mean comment... Users can block other users for whatever reason they see fit!
