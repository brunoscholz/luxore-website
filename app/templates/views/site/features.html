						The Looks, your photos, will live in your Vitrine - a fancy french name for the "feed".
						Your followers see everything you post there, following a style, a trend, or your creativity...
						You can explore your looks, your body type, events, make-up, hair-style, shoes, underwear, socks,
						bracelets, necklaces... Anything you want.
						The idea is to be found and be on command of your own style!

						To describe the look you can tag it, like "party formal dinner long-dress", plus situations such as wedding, 
						new years eve, or walking my dog on the beach, and body types like pear, plus-size, skinny, etc. 
						When you apply tags to your looks, people can find you and cheer your work. 
						Tags make it easy to find everything about fashion filtering the search results by what matters to you!

					<p>
						Yeah, we have a coin! LUX is a token, a cryto-currency, built on top of <a href="http://lisk.io">Lisk</a>
						which is a platform for building blockchains and decentralized apps!<br>
						The idea is to cut off the bureocracy and, like other crypto-currencies, be safe.
						All the financial transactions inside Luxore network will be made with LUX. That guarantees
						the valuation of the whole system. There will be created 1 billion coins in two years,
						and it will not be possible to create more or less than this! Every user will have an address
						that works like your bank account number and you can send and receive money with it, protected by
						a passphrase that only you know.

						A feature borrowed from games are achievements systems. They stimulate and engage people.
						Thophies and badges are virtual rewards given to users by their performance and they will be tied to 
						professional paths: if you like make-up, you can post about it and become a reference by going deeper 
						into the subject, gaining visibility, having others loving your work, and for each accomplishment you will
						have a badge, a title, or a trophy to show and proof of your dedication!
						They can be used as guide showing the way to more engagement and earnings.
						In games, characters with a higher level are more likely to beat the challenges of the stages, users with higher
						achievements beat easily the barriers of visualization... But all in funny way!

						Being social is the whole point so don't be mean - read about our ethical guidelines <a ui-sref="app.ethics" class="linx">here</a>. 
						When you like a look, you should show your apreciation as well as when you dislike it. To any look, you have 2 buttons: cheer and boo!
						They are the more common way you can interact with others and participate in the network...
						You can also share the look with your followers or put it inside a list...
						Of course, you can leave a comment too. The comments can be deleted by the Look owner or they can be flaged as inappropriated: a snake 
						will be placed in it so other people know that is a mean comment...
						Users can block other users for whatever reason they see fit!
