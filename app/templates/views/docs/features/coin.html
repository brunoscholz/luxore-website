						<h4>Introduction</h4>
						<p class="caption">
							Cryptocurrencies are a new trend! They can solve a lot of problems:
						</p>
						<h5>Non technical</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>It works more or less like mileage program</li>
							<li>You earn LUX coins by "working": posting, validating, visiting, creating and participating</li>
							<li>You can buy and sell LUX coins</li>
							<li>You control them with your password</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Inflation</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>Inflation is when more money is printed than it is needed; Digital coins don't suffer from this</li>
							<li>There will be a limited number of LUX - 1 billion - ever</li>
							<li>No one can create more</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Secure</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>LUX is decentralized - no one have control over it's creation after the deployment</li>
							<li>All transactions are encrypted</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Value</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>Value is subjective; If people use it or accept it, there are value involved</li>
							<li>Since LUX is the only currency accepted inside Luxore, there is already a demand for it</li>
							<li>The only way of advertise is paying in LUX</li>
							<li>You can buy LUX from anyone willing to sell</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div id="creation" class="section scrollspy">
						<h4>Creation of LUX</h4>
						<p class="caption">
							
						</p>
						<h5>Distribution - Part 1</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>A digital smart contract will be responsible for issuing the coin at a fixed rate, every week for two years.</li>
							<li>The first issuance will be of LUX 100,000,000, distributed like this:</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Distribution - Part 2</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>From issuance #2 on, the value is calculated according to the document available <a class="linx" href="#0">here</a></li>
							<li>Every week, more coins will be created and distributed according to the graph bellow:</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Valuation</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>When the 2 years are over, no more inflation will be possible</li>
							<li>Now, the economic laws of supply and demand apply as a whole</li>
							<li>The supply will remain fixed - No one can ever create more LUX</li>
							<li>The demand is variable and the willingness will raise the value, so the more people using it, the more valuable it is!</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div id="proofs" class="section scrollspy">
						<h4>Proofs</h4>
						<p class="caption">Like all other cryptocurrency, LUX needs proofs!</p>
						<h5>Proof of Value</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>By posting a Look, you have the ownership over it</li>
							<li>When people like it, it means people value it</li>
							<li>The more successful the Look is, the more value it has</li>
							<li>The Look will receive points, PROVING it is valuable</li>
							<li>The table shows the point distribution:</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Proof of Participation</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>By participating in the processes you earn points</li>
							<li>By helping good content reach more people, you earn points</li>
							<li>By helping the network stay healthy, you earn points</li>
							<li>Anyway, according to the bellow, you earn points</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Points?</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>The points (crystals, jewels, gems) will reset every week</li>
							<li>They are proof that someone did something</li>
							<li>They will be handled by a smart contract in the blockchain</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>So, points don't pay my rent!!</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>The total issued coins every week, will be divided, proportionaly, to every point owner</li>
							<li>The coins paid for ads inside Looks, will be divided the same way</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Exemple:</h5>
						<p>Let's say we are in week #14 of the issuance. According to the <a class="linx" href="#0">table</a>, LUX 15,944,556.99 will be created that week.</p>
						<p>Consider you posted 4 Looks that week:</p>

						<h4>In the not too distant future...</h4>
						<p class="caption">in this very same galaxy!</p>
						<p>The idea behind digital coins is freedom...</p>
						<p></p>
						<h5>Next Steps</h5>
						<ul class="normal-list">
							<li>We will introduce an ecommerce platform for the <a class="linx" ui-sref="docs.studios">Studios</a>, as soon as the coin has some value</li>
							<li>The goal is to have more people and businesses accepting it</li>
							<li>See flourish a free market of trade!</li>
						</ul>
