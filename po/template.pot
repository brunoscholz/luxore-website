Well, besides the use of decetralization, we made lots of types of rewards and incentives so it can be always focused on fashion. As we cannot ban, remove, or spank anyone, we gave you the powerful and efficient Physical Removal service, a.k.a block. You can also delete all the comments you don't like - but wait, there is more: When other people are beeing lower than a snake's belly or a real Retard McTardypants you have 3 options: (1) Start a dance fight/contest - not recommended, though. (2) LALALALALALA CAN’T HEAR. And (3), our favoritte, flag the comment as poisonous, toxic waste. Next comments of the flagged individuals will stink until they make amends."
